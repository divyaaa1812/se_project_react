## About the project

Hello there! I'm Divya. As a passionate developer and fashion enthusiast, I embarked on this journey to blend technology with style, creating a seamless and enjoyable experience for users seeking outfit suggestions.

My mission is to simplify the daily dilemma of choosing the perfect outfit. What to Wear app is here to offer personalized suggestions based on your preferences and the weather forecast.

The idea behind implementing this is, we make use of weather API which responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

## Tech Stack

On the backend, What to Wear web application is powered by Express.js and MongoDB
The frontend, crafted with React JS, provides a delightful user interface
The project integrates a weather API to provide real-time weather information, enhancing the accuracy of outfit recommendations
